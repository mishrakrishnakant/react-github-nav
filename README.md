# A package for creating Navigation Panels to host on simple hosting services like Github



## Usage

1. Install with `npm install --save react-github-nav` 
2. Go to the page where you would want to have the Nav and add this to the render section of your code `<GitNav NavTexts={
	['Google',
	'Facebook']}
	NavURLs={
	['http://google.com',
	'http://facebook.com']}
	/>`
3. Bonus tip - Use the component in the main App.js/Index.js to keep it universal (It's logical but I suppose I should mention it anyways)
